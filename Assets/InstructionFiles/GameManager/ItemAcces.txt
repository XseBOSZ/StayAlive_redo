This script is optional - its for debugging that our Items form (Assets/Resources/Items/Scriptable) are read properly
results will be shown in debug console after pressing F1 in game

there is no need to asign anything but keep in mind:
this script have private reference to UIController and asign it by "UIC = gameObject.GetComponent<UIControler>();" 
so it must be on GameManager with UIControler on it
