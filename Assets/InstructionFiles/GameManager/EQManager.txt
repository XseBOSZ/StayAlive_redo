This is essential script needed to whole EquipmentSystem works. 

It's responsible for picking up objects, adding it to hotbar, adding it to Equipment and destroying object from scene
to avoid item duplicating.

From variables we dont need to asign anything, "Hotbar" and "BP" are asigned by "FindObjectOfType<T>();" so we can skip having it 
on the same Object. "Looking At" and "Looking At Obj" are asigned in other scripts.
