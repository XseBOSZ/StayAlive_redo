Oh boi, i regret that i'm writing this 2 mhonts after writing this script but i'll do it anyway.

This script is Controller for every UI in the scene. I created this for easy script-level acces for UI elements
mainly becouse i dont wanna write 4 times one reference for popup, instead this i have "UIController UIC;" reference and
then i can use "UIC.PopUp.text = "";" to edit popup message.

Following Script have this Variables:
1. UI_list
2. Console Content
3. PopUp
4. Item Button
5. EQ Content
6. Recipe Content
7. BP
8. CC
9. MUI

To properly functioning we need to asign following items to following components:
!X. Vairiable -> Component (object on scene)!


1. UI_list (need to provide size of array)
     UI_list[0] -> ConsoleUI(FPController>FPCamera>Canvas)
     UI_list[2] -> Equipment(FPController>FPCamera>Canvas)
     UI_list[3] -> Popup(FPController>FPCamera>Canvas)
     UI_list[4] -> Crafting(FPController>FPCamera>Canvas)
!For every additional UI box we need to have after pressing a button we need to assign it here!

2. Console Content -> Text(FPController>FPCamera>Canvas>ConsoleUI>Panel)
3. PopUp -> PopUp(Equipment(FPController>FPCamera>Canvas) 
    note: this is not duplicating same variable form UI_list, ihis is used to manipulate the text not the object

4. Item Button -> Button.prefab(Assets>Prefabs)
5. EQ Content -> Content(FPController>FPCamera>Canvas>Equipment>Panel>Scroll View>Viewport)
6. Recipe Conetnt -> Conent(FPController>FPCamera>Canvas>Crafting>Scroll View>Viewport)

BP,CC,MUI are asigned in Scipt by "FindObjectOfType<T>" so there is no need to asign them in inspector but make sure there are on object
