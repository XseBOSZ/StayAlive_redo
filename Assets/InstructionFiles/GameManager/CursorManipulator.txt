This script is used to enable/disable cursor visibility and lock/unlock position of it.

Following script have 2 variables:
1. UIC
2. Is Locked

we dont need to asign UIC becouse it have "UIC = GetComponent<UIControler>();" so it need to be with UIContoller with on 
the same GameObject but it have an if statement that checking for asignment so you can place it anywhere and !asign in 
inspector!. For "Is Locked" we'll do nothing - its just inspecor view of cursor state. Its public becouse every time 
when i press [ESC] unity automaticly unlocks the cursor so i keep this bool public to check if this script does it thing.

It will do what it's supposed to do in builds of the game - for now it's hanging on object and waiting for build.
