    //to not lose the concept - this script is being called by main hotbar script to simply do shit in ScriptableObject's and GameObject's
    //this will hold actual in game component and reference from backback to just click '1' on numpad and select #1 slot for example
    //to use/equip. This will become handy as long as i will keep the concept of hotbar
